# LibraNet - A Spring Boot Library Management Web App ðŸ“š

Welcome to LibraNet! This is a simple, web-based library management system built with Java and the Spring Boot framework. It allows users to view a catalog of library items (books, audiobooks, e-magazines), borrow them, and return them. The system features a clean user interface and an automated fine calculation system based on due dates.

This project is an excellent example of a modern Model-View-Controller (MVC) web application.

## âœ¨ Features

- **View Catalog:** Browse a complete list of all library items.
- **Borrow Items:** Borrow any available item with a single click.
- **Return Items:** Return a borrowed item to make it available again.
- **Automated Due Dates:** When an item is borrowed, a due date is automatically set for a 14-day loan period.
- **Automatic Fine Calculation:** If an item is returned after its due date, a fine is automatically calculated and recorded.
